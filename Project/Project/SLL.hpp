 ************************************************************************
 ************************************************************************
 This header file contains the Singly Linked List for the tables.
 Three classes were created:
 
 1. Customer
 2. Table
 3. Singly Linked List
 
 The customer will be implemented in a vector and it's part of each table.
 At first all tables are assumed to be empty (zero customers) and when
 customers are assigned a table then immediately a vector of customers
 needs to be created for that specific table.
 
 The SLL should be able to be traversed and printed. In case more tables need
 to be added, it should be able to do that as well.
 
 Table 1     Table 2     Table 3            Table N
 ****        ****        ****               ****
